## Type of Change

<!-- pick the appropriate option and delete the other one -->
Breaking | Compatible

<!--
Breaking: Any change that would require a user of npm-pack-here to have to change their workflow or how their tool integrates.

Compatible: Any change that is not breaking, for example adding new behavior or fixing an breaking behavior.

Due to the nature of software and how people integrate with tools. Sometimes "bug fixes" might be considered a breaking change. In the cases an undesired behavior is being changed we might decide to label it as breaking because of the possibility of an existing user depending on that behavior. In cases like these use your best judgement, please tell us about your reasoning.
